  <p>I am a <a href="{{ site.baseurl }}{% link menu/teaching.md %}">lecturer</a> at
  Humboldt University Berlin and Chief Artificial Intelligence Officer at SO1.</p>

  <p>My <a href="{{ site.baseurl }}{% link menu/publications.md %}">research</a> is
  located at the intersection of quantitative marketing, machine learning and
  econometrics. I develop and validate new machine learning methods for modeling the
  behavior of individual customers. My current projects focus on methodological research
  in Deep Learning that can be applied to promotion personalization, recommender systems,
  pricing, and assortment optimization in large-scale retailing settings.</p>

  <p>In my industry work at SO1, I collaborate with leading marketing solution providers
  and grocery retailers to design and implement advanced machine learning systems for
  scalable and automated marketing personalization. These marketing solutions have helped
  retailers to increase their revenue, return on advertising spend, and conversion
  rates.</p>

  <p>My work with retailers and marketing solution providers enables me to build a
  research agenda of high practical value. Industry partnerships open up the opportunity
  to evaluate new methodologies in real-world settings.</p>
