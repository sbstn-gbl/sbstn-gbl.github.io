  <p>I am an <a href="https://www.rsm.nl/people/sebastian-gabel">associate
  professor</a> at the Rotterdam School of Management, Erasmus University, and I
  serve as Scientific Advisor at the <a href="https://verve.com">Verve Group</a>.</p>

  <p>My <a href="{{ site.baseurl }}{% link menu/research.md %}">research</a> is
  located at the intersection of quantitative marketing, machine learning and
  econometrics. My most recent projects center around designing and implementing
  Foundation Models for retailing. More broadly, I develop and validate new
  (deep) machine learning methods for modeling the behavior of individual customers.
  Projects focus on methodological research in Deep Learning that can be applied to
  promotion personalization, recommender systems, pricing, and assortment optimization
   in large-scale retailing settings.</p>

  <p>In my industry work, I collaborate with leading marketing solution providers and
  grocery retailers to design and implement advanced machine learning systems for scalable
  and automated marketing personalization. These marketing solutions have helped retailers
  to increase their revenue, return on advertising spend, and conversion rates.</p>
