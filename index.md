  <p>I am an <a href="{{ site.baseurl }}{% link menu/teaching.md %}">assistant
  professor</a> at the Rotterdam School of Management, Erasmus University and the
  Scientific Advisor at Schwarz Media Platform.</p>

  <p>My <a href="{{ site.baseurl }}{% link menu/publications.md %}">research</a> is
  located at the intersection of quantitative marketing, machine learning and
  econometrics. I develop and validate new machine learning methods for modeling the
  behavior of individual customers. My current projects focus on methodological research
  in Deep Learning that can be applied to promotion personalization, recommender systems,
  pricing, and assortment optimization in large-scale retailing settings.</p>

  <p>In my industry work, I collaborate with leading marketing solution providers and
  grocery retailers to design and implement advanced machine learning systems for scalable
  and automated marketing personalization. These marketing solutions have helped retailers
  to increase their revenue, return on advertising spend, and conversion rates.</p>
