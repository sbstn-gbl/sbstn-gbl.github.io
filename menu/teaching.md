### "Machine Learning in Marketing: Theory and Applications" (WS 2020/21)

I have developed this course with master students from quantitative fields such as
marketing, economics, statistics and computer science in mind. The course has the goal to
prepare students in their last year of study for solving real-world marketing problems
using modern quantitative methods.

The course first reviews theoretical foundations in marketing, statistics, and probability
theory that are required to understand and customize complex statistical models. The
course teaches how to formalize marketing decisions as machine learning problems and
equips students with the necessary tools to efficiently implement machine learning
pipelines. After completing this course participants will be able to judge how modern
machine learning methods complement (or even replace) traditional statistical methods for
data analysis and decision-making.


### Guest Lectures "Machine Learning in Marketing"

Over the last couple of years I was invited by universities (e.g., MIT Sloan School of
Management, WHU School of Management) to give guest lectures about my experience with
applying machine learning to marketing problems. The lectures draw from my research as
well as my industry experience that I have gained from my work as an entrepreneur in
several start-ups. After reviewing basic principles from marketing theory, I provide
examples for formalizing marketing decisions as machine learning problems. I present
real-world results derived from field experiments that evaluate the economic benefits of
promotion personalization and recommender systems.
