### Learning from Big Data, BSc (2021/22, 2022/23)

Every day, millions of consumers voice their opinions in product-review websites, blogs,
and chat rooms. At the same time, retailers collect rich data sets that contain valuable
information from their loyalty programs. In this era of big data, the availability of new,
larger, and more diversified data sets creates exciting opportunities for marketing
practitioners. All that is needed to address these challenges is the right set of tools
and the training that helps you to use the tools correctly. This course first teaches how
to formalize marketing problems as statistical models. It then shows how to solve
marketing problems by complementing classical econometric techniques with modern machine
learning (ML) methods. Students learn the needed tools and conceptual frameworks needed to
identify and exploit the opportunities that big data sources create.

### Machine Learning in Marketing: Theory and Applications, MSc (2020/21)

I developed this course for students from quantitative fields such as quantitative
marketing, OR, economics, statistics and computer science in mind. The course prepares
students in their last year of study for solving real-world marketing problems using
modern quantitative methods. The course first reviews theoretical foundations in
marketing, statistics, and probability theory and then shows how to formalize marketing
decisions as machine learning problems. It also equips students with the necessary tools
to implement machine learning pipelines efficiently.

### Guest Lectures "Machine Learning in Marketing"

My guest lectures (e.g., MIT Sloan School of Management, WHU School of Management) are
based on my research as well as my industry experience that I have gained from founding
several machine learning start-ups. I present real-world results derived from field
experiments that evaluate the economic benefits of promotion personalization based on
modern machine learning stacks.
