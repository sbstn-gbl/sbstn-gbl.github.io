### "Machine Learning in Marketing: Theory and Applications" (WS 2020/21)

I have developed this course with master students from quantitative fields such as
marketing, economics, statistics and computer science in mind. The course's goal is to
prepare students in their last year of study for solving real-world marketing problems
using modern quantitative methods. The course first reviews theoretical foundations in
marketing, statistics, and probability theory and then shows how to formalize marketing
decisions as machine learning problems. It also equips students with the necessary tools
to implement machine learning pipelines efficiently.

### Guest Lectures "Machine Learning in Marketing"

My guest lectures (e.g., MIT Sloan School of Management, WHU School of Management) are
based on my research as well as my industry experience that I have gained from founding
several machine learning start-ups. I present real-world results derived from field
experiments that evaluate the economic benefits of promotion personalization based on
modern machine learning stacks.
